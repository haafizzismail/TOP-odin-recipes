<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Gordon's time in the Smoky Mountains led to the discovery of an amazing farmstead cheese 
    made from raw cow's milk, flavored with basil and dried tomatoes. 
    Local ingredients like crawfish and mushrooms take this omelette 
    out of the mountains and into your mouth.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 shallot, sliced into rings</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, sliced thin</li>
    <li>2 hen of the woods mushrooms</li>
    <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>Unsalted butter</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup lightly blanched crawfish meat*</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
    <li>4 scallions, white and light green parts sliced</li>
    <li>Yellow Branch Tomato Basil Cheese*</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Heat two nonstick skillets over medium-high heat. 
        Once hot, add a couple of teaspoons of oil to one pan, 
        followed by the shallot, garlic and mushrooms, then season with a pinch of 
        red pepper flakes. Add a couple of small pinches of butter to the pan and swirl, 
        then let sit so everything can begin to caramelize. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Crack the eggs into a bowl and lightly whisk.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the crawfish meat to the pan with the vegetables. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Add 2 tablespoons butter to the other skillet and let it melt and foam. 
        Toss the crawfish mixture while the butter melts.
    </li>
    <li>
        Season the eggs with salt and pepper then pour into the skillet. 
        Rapidly swirl and shake the pan while using a spatula to stir and break up the eggs, 
        then flatten them out once they start to cook.
    </li>
    <li>
        Generously grate the cheese directly onto the eggs, 
        then spoon the crawfish mixture in a line down the center of the eggs. 
        Scatter the scallions all over.
    </li>
    <li>
        To serve, tilt the pan up and begin to fold the sides of the eggs up 
        and over the crawfish mixture. Once folded, lift a plate up toward the pan 
        and let the omelette flip itself out onto the plate so that the mix is completely 
        covered by the eggs and everything is tucked in nicely. Grate more cheese 
        on top of the omelette, followed by a few slices of scallions and serve.
    </li>
</ol>

    *If you canâ€™t get your hands on these local delicacies at home, 
    you could use lobster, crab or shrimp meat, 
    and any sort of tomato basil cheddar or any local cheese from your area 
    that tickles your fancy.
