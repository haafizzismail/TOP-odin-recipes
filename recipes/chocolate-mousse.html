<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A surprisingly decadent pudding that is so much better for you than the egg-based classic.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 large ripe avocados, peeled and stoned</li>
    <li>3–4 tbsp runny honey, to taste</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>50g raw cacao powder</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put the avocados into a food processor and blend until smooth.</li>
    <li>
        Add 3 tablespoons of the honey with the vanilla 
        and cacao powder and blend again until completely combined. 
        Taste and add more honey if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spoon the mousse into 8 shot or sweet wine glasses 
        and put them into the fridge for an hour before serving.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>How to Measure Honey</h4>
<p>
    Because honey is so sticky, it can be difficult to measure it accurately – 
    so much can be left behind on the spoon! 
    If, however, you coat the measuring spoon with a thin layer of flavourless oil 
    like groundnut, it will slip right off, ensuring that the right amount of honey 
    makes it into your cooking.
